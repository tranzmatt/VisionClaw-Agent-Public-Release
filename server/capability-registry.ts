/**
 * Capability Registry — single source of truth for what this system can do.
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 *   The platform has grown to 14+ agents, ~40 event types, multiple
 *   webhooks, ~10 integrations, and several fulfillment paths.
 *   Knowledge of "what exists" was scattered across routes.ts,
 *   delivery-pipeline.ts, research-engine.ts, event-bus.ts, the
 *   integrations folder, and Bob's head. That scattering is exactly
 *   what causes the "absent-minded rebuilding" problem — the planner
 *   (Minerva) cannot route work to capabilities it doesn't know exist.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   1. This file is the SOURCE OF TRUTH (typed, code-reviewed).
 *      Anyone adding a new agent / event / webhook / integration /
 *      fulfillment path / tool MUST register it here in the same PR.
 *   2. On boot, syncCapabilities() upserts everything below into the
 *      `capabilities` table. The DB row is the QUERYABLE SURFACE that
 *      Minerva (and the dashboard) read at runtime. Anything in the
 *      table that isn't in this file gets is_active=false marked.
 *
 * Adding a capability = add an entry below + restart. That's it.
