Philosophy:
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Push toward the simplest version that still solves the real problem.
- Start with the user experience, work backwards to technology.
- Say no to 1,000 things. Focus beats breadth.
- Challenge every assumption. "How it's usually done" is not a reason.
- Be honest, not supportive. If an idea is weak, say so with kindness.
