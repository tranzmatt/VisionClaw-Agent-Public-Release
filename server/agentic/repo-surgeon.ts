/**
 * repo-surgeon.ts — Repo Surgeon Task #52
 *
 * The GUARDED CODE-FIX EXECUTOR. The missing self-repair loop: take an incident
 * the #51 classifier routed to `repo_surgeon` (a genuine code defect), diagnose
 * the root cause in real source, write a minimal diff that mirrors house
 * patterns, verify it for real (typecheck + targeted tests + golden-path replay
 * + re-running the failed job), and LAND it on green or ROLL BACK cleanly on red.
 * It is ONE guarded executor that every detector routes into — not a fourth
 * parallel self-repair system.
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * HARD INVARIANTS (non-negotiable — task #52 / replit.md AHB):
 *  1. NEVER make a check pass by weakening, disabling, or deleting a guard,
 *     test, or safety profile. Enforced TWICE, fail-closed:
 *       (a) PATH DENYLIST — re-run `enforceSafetyRouting()` from the #51
 *           classifier with the ACTUAL diff's touched files (the apply-time
 *           contract documented at repair-incident.ts:356). If the would-be fix
 *           touches a test/guard/safety surface, it escalates — never applies.
 *       (b) OUT-OF-BAND DIFF SCAN — `diffWeakensGuard()` inspects the diff
 *           CONTENT (not just paths): removed assertions/guard calls, added
 *           `.skip`/`@ts-nocheck`/`eslint-disable`, dropped tenant scoping, etc.
 *           Any hit escalates. This catches a guard weakened INSIDE a
 *           non-protected file, which the path denylist alone would miss.
 *  2. SENSITIVE SURFACES (auth / payments / schema / safety) PAUSE for owner
 *     HITL sign-off before landing — the diff is produced and guard-checked,
 *     then an approval is opened and the executor stops (a Resume task applies
 *     it after sign-off). It never auto-merges a sensitive surface.
 *  3. AFTER TWO FAILED FIX ATTEMPTS on the same incident, STOP — summarize and
 *     escalate rather than loop (mirrors the replit.md 2-failed-corrections
 *     rule). The cap is durable (counted from `repo_surgeon_attempts`) so it
 *     holds across separate executor invocations, not just the in-process loop.
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The pure decision helpers (`touchedFilesFromProposal`, `runGuardInvariant`,
 * `diffWeakensGuard`, `isSensitiveSurface`, `attemptBudget`,
 * `buildVerificationPlan`) are exported and side-effect-free so they can be
 * unit-tested without a DB, the LLM, or a shell — mirroring the #51 classifier's
 * pure/stateful split. `runRepoSurgeon()` is the stateful orchestrator; every
 * heavy dependency is injectable (defaults wire the real LLM / fs / shell / DB)
 * so the loop is fully testable with stubs.
 *
 * Untrusted-input note (replit.md): an incident's text and the LLM's diff
 * proposal are UNTRUSTED. The executor never builds a shell string from them —
 * verification runs via `spawnSync` with argv arrays (no shell), test targets
 * are validated against a strict path allowlist, and the "re-run the failed job"
 * step re-invokes the failed TOOL through the guarded executor, never an
 * arbitrary command.
