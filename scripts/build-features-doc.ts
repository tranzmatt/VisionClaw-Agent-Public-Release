          "R125+54 (2026-06-20) — Difficulty-adaptive UP-route: the AUTO path now escalates genuinely-hard requests to the high-end model instead of answering cheap-and-shallow — the mirror of the existing illusory-productivity down-route guard. The orchestration-efficiency guard already down-routed trivial requests away from the expensive heavy loop (arXiv:2605.22687); this round adds the opposite direction — when a request looks genuinely hard (complexity markers / length / cross-domain reasoning) but wouldn't otherwise trip the heavy ensemble, the AUTO path UP-routes it to the high-end model and tags the orchestration request_class='adaptive-hard-route', counted by a new upRouteCount metric on the Orchestration Efficiency card on /admin/ecosystem-health. ADVISORY + fail-open: it only ever shapes the AUTOMATIC route and never blocks or skips an explicit ensemble_query / jury_triage call; telemetry is fire-and-forget so it can never slow or throw into the chat hot path; the cost-exempt scoping of the sanctioned up-route is locked by a static regression test. Shipped behind a whole-app + 72h code review — two parallel architect passes (sensitive core + revenue/agentic/jobs), both PASS, 0 CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM. Agent-wiring audit CLEAN (393 tools, 0 dead/drift/leak), tsc + esbuild build green, preflight stale-strings CLEAN.

          "R125+53 (2026-06-19) — Actor-Critic Reflection in the supervisor loop (Bob's idea): when an agent tries something, it fails, loops, retries and STILL spins with no success, the platform no longer just halts or blindly upgrades the model — a SECOND independent LLM (the critic-coach) reads the actual failed output, diagnoses WHY it failed, and hands targeted 'do this / don't repeat that' guidance back to the SAME primary loop for one more INFORMED retry, paired with a model escalation (the 'Combined' mode). The critic runs as an ISOLATED completion (reviewer-independence invariant — failed output passed as DATA, never by threading live conversation history); fails OPEN (any error/unparseable result falls through to the existing halt); a single decideStuckRecovery gate; escalation clamped at 2 and never downgrades. Shipped behind a whole-app + 72h code review — architect PASS, 0 CRITICAL/HIGH — that closed 2 MEDIUM: (1) a session-scoped pg_advisory_lock in auto-consolidation is now released in a finally block (gotLock-guarded, fail-soft) so it can never outlive the run and starve future tenant consolidation; (2) a stale '208 tables' → '210' corrected on the pricing + about pages.

Closed 1 LOW client information-leak: the AI Daily Briefing routes (server/routes/briefings.ts) returned raw server err.message text to the browser on 500 errors across 9 handlers; all nine now log the real error server-side and return a generic 'Internal server error', so internal database/provider detail can no longer leak to the client.

Closed 4 findings. (1) Cost-cap backstop — second_opinion + venture_discovery added to the dispatcher's HARDCODED_EXPENSIVE set so the per-call spend throttle still fires even if the rate-limiter config fails to load (defense-in-depth, MEDIUM). (2) Tenant isolation — auto-transcript.ts projects SELECT now scoped AND tenant_id=... with a fail-closed return, gating the downstream project_files writes against a poisoned conversation.project_id. (3) Fail-soft — the token-efficiency probe import in ecosystem-health.ts moved inside the per-probe try with a full-shape default so a probe-module load error degrades just that one card instead of throwing the whole /admin/ecosystem-health call. (4) Stat fix — audit.tsx founder quote 392 → 393 tools. Architect re-review PASS, preflight stale-strings CLEAN. _(model: anthropic/claude-opus-4)_",

Three READ-ONLY per-request overhead metrics make wasted spend measurable instead of a vibe: (1) cache-hit starvation — cache-hit % on large (≥5000-token) prompts over 30 days from agent_cost_ledger (cached is a SUBSET of tokens_in), breached when sample≥20 ∧ hit<20%; (2) instruction bloat — the fixed system-prompt token tax measured live via buildSystemPrompt on a synthetic persona (bounded 3000ms, fail-soft); (3) MCP tool bloat — the serialized tool-catalog JSON token tax via getAllToolDefinitions. Tenant-scoped end to end (ledger SQL WHERE tenant_id; explicit tenantId into both fixed-overhead probes), degraded-over-healthy-zeros honesty, fail-soft (never throws).

(1) auto-transcript linked-conversation backfill SELECTed an always-NULL project_id and wrote NULL back over itself; now SELECTs the project_conversations project_id AND JOINs projects with a tenant guard so a poisoned cross-tenant link row can't stamp a foreign project onto a conversation. (2) the briefings widget/generate routes gained Zod validation, which then surfaced + fixed a 0-coordinate truthiness bug at both POST /generate guards (valid equator/prime-meridian 0/0 locations were being skipped) — switched to nullish checks. tsc green. _(model: anthropic/claude-opus-4)_",

(1) Settle-on-no-spend — live stages settled the budget reservation at the default estimate in a finally even when the paid call threw or fell back to deterministic ($0 real spend), burning a full stage's daily cap for nothing; now settle ONLY on a real completion and release the reservation otherwise. (2) Non-atomic stage advance — approveNextStage read-then-unconditionally-set 'running' let two concurrent approves double-execute a stage (dup budget + dup ideas/scores rows); a new atomic claim-CAS (WHERE id ∧ tenant_id ∧ observed status ∧ observed stage) makes the loser return stage_conflict. tsc green. _(model: anthropic/claude-opus-4)_",
          "R125+52.42 (2026-06-17) — Whole-app + 72h code review (architect PASS) hardened the new second_opinion / Fusion $25/day owner-only cost cap against cost-drift overshoot (architect HIGH → accepted LOW): (1) a deterministic worst-case reservation clamp floors every reservation at max(configured, ~$1.15) (capped in/out tokens × premium rates × a 10× panel→judge→synth multiplier) plus hard output-token / question-length caps; (2) a fail-closed cost-drift latch compares the REAL OpenRouter usage.cost vs reserved on every call and, on the first overshoot, trips an idempotent never-throws latch that disables BOTH the AUTO low-κ hook AND the on-demand path (unless ownerOverride) + pages the owner; (3) a dynamic reserve floor lifts each reservation to max(staticEstimate, MAX(real settled cost today)) so a drifted price can't be repeatedly under-reserved. +11 query-free guard tests (20/20). Known cosmetic doc-only MEDIUM: openrouter/fusion is unpriced in the registry so its ledger row reads $0 until a price is set — the cap math uses OpenRouter's returned usage.cost, not the registry price, so the cap is unaffected.
