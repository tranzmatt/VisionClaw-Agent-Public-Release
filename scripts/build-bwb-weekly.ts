/**
 * Built With Bob — WEEKLY RECAP builder.
 *
 * Bob films a short selfie clip most mornings and uploads each to YouTube
 * (also Facebook). Once a week he pastes that week's 5-7 Short URLs here; this
 * script:
 *   1. Extracts every transcript (yt-dlp audio → ElevenLabs Scribe).
 *   2. Synthesizes them into ONE weekly "story" via the LLM, written as a
 *      full Built With Bob narrated video script (chapters of scenes).
 *   3. Opens on Bob's photo (hero image, scene 1), narrated in Bob's Fish
 *      Audio voice clone.
 *   4. Hands the script JSON to the CANONICAL builder (scripts/build-bwb-video.ts)
 *      which validates brand rules, pre-bakes images, renders 1080p/30fps,
 *      makes a thumbnail, and delivers via deliverDigitalProduct.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   URLS="https://youtube.com/shorts/AAA, https://youtube.com/shorts/BBB" \
 *   WEEK_LABEL="Week of May 26" \
 *   npx tsx scripts/build-bwb-weekly.ts
 *
 * Or point at a JSON file: { "weekLabel": "...", "urls": [...], "playlist": "The Build", "heroImagePath": "..." }
 *   WEEKLY=data/youtube/weekly/2026-05-30.json npx tsx scripts/build-bwb-weekly.ts
 *
 * Flags:
 *   DRY_RUN=1   stop after writing the script JSON (skip render/deliver) — used to validate the chain.
 *   PLAYLIST    override playlist (default "The Build").
 *   HERO_IMAGE  override opening photo.
 *   TARGET_MIN  target video minutes (default 4.5).
 *
 * Do NOT roll your own render/delivery here — this feeds build-bwb-video.ts on purpose.

Produce a SINGLE narrated video script of about ${cfg.targetMinutes} minutes, structured as
EXACTLY ${targetScenes} scenes total (treat them as ~4-5 chapters of ~4-5 scenes each, but
output ONE flat scenes array).

Scene 1 is Bob's on-camera intro over his real photo and its narration is FIXED — the
pipeline overrides it with Bob's locked opener, so just emit a short placeholder for scene 1
(no imagePrompt). Scenes 2 through ${targetScenes} are the ACTUAL weekly recap: review Bob's
week from the clip transcripts above — the daily walks, the bike rides, the wins, the
struggles, and the lessons — and build the story from THAT. Every scene 2+ needs FINAL spoken
narration AND a cinematic imagePrompt.
