/**
 * Built With Bob — FULLY AUTONOMOUS weekly recap orchestrator.
 *
 * One agent-runnable entrypoint (no TTY, env-configured, meaningful exit codes):
 *
 *   1. Hand off to scripts/build-bwb-weekly.ts — which AUTO-DISCOVERS this
 *      week's short-form dailies from the connected @built-with-bob channel by
 *      upload date (excluding the ~5-min weekly long-form so there's no feedback
 *      loop), transcribes them, synthesizes one ~5-min weekly story in Bob's
 *      Fish voice clone (opens on his on-file photo), generates a thumbnail, and
 *      delivers the MP4 to Bob via the canonical delivery pipeline. That builder
 *      writes a machine-readable result sidecar per produced video.
 *
 *   2. Pick up the produced result sidecar.
 *
 *   3. LAUNCH POSTURE = APPROVAL-FIRST (default): create a durable approval row
 *      and email Bob a one-tap approve/deny link. The single autonomy switch is
 *      BWB_WEEKLY_AUTOPUBLISH=1 → publish immediately to YouTube (public) +
 *      native Facebook video, no human in the loop.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 success · 2 nothing produced · 3 build failed · 4 publish/notify failed.

 * Schedule guard — the orchestrator is fired by BOTH the restart-safe weekly
 * cron (server/bwb-weekly-cron.ts) AND the "BWB Weekly Render" autostart
 * workflow, which re-runs the orchestrator on EVERY workspace boot.
 *
 * AUTONOMOUS AUTO-RENDER IS OFF BY DEFAULT (Bob's request 2026-06-17): only a
 * MANUAL run that Bob initiates renders. The bwb_weekly_build tool sets
 * BWB_WEEKLY_FORCE=1, which bypasses this guard; any non-forced invocation
 * (boot-fire or cron) is a clean no-op exit. That is what "cancel the auto-
 * generate, keep only the manual recap I initiate on Sat night / Sun morning"
 * means in code — Bob picks the moment, nothing renders on its own.
 *
 * To RE-ENABLE the autonomous weekend schedule, set BWB_WEEKLY_AUTONOMOUS=1.
 * When enabled, two fail-safe gates keep it to one recap per weekend:
 *   1. weekend window — only render on the allowed weekday(s) in BWB_WEEKLY_TZ
 *      (default Sat/Sun, America/Chicago)
 *   2. min-gap idempotency — skip if a recap was already produced within the
 *      last BWB_WEEKLY_MIN_GAP_DAYS (default 2) days.
 * Returns a non-null reason string when the run should be skipped.
