/**
 * Jury FIX-queue drainer — closes the jury → implement → repo-surgeon loop.
 *
 * `jury_triage` (and the CI self-healer) write FIX verdicts to
 * `data/jury-decisions/queue.json` when JURY_AUTOAPPLY=1, but NOTHING consumed
 * them — the queue was write-only, so a jury-approved FIX never reached an
 * implementer. This drainer reads the queue and routes each unprocessed FIX
 * entry through `captureIncident()` — the SAME seam the CI self-healer uses — so
 * it inherits every existing guard rather than re-implementing (or weakening)
 * any of them:
 *
 *   · mapJuryDecision: ONLY a unanimous (3/3) FIX with no escalation flag and
 *     adequate fix-concordance routes to repo_surgeon; a 2/3 split / shouldEscalate
 *     / low concordance escalates to the owner instead of auto-fixing.
 *   · sensitive-path FIX verdicts are already kept OUT of the queue at write time;
 *     we also skip any entry tagged sensitive here as belt-and-braces.
 *   · dispatchIncidentRemedy gates the actual code-apply behind REPAIR_AUTOFIX_ENABLED
 *     (fails CLOSED — records "autofix_disabled" if the flag is off).
 *   · repo-surgeon runs typecheck/test, lands or rolls back, enforces the
 *     2-failed-attempt stop, and escalates every non-landed terminal outcome.
 *
 * This script NEVER applies code itself — it only feeds the existing pipeline.
 * Idempotent: each handled entry is stamped `_drained` and skipped next run; a
 * transient capture failure is left un-stamped so it retries.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/drain-jury-queue.ts [--once]
 *   JURY_AUTOAPPLY=1            jury-triage / CI-healer actually write the queue
 *   REPAIR_AUTOFIX_ENABLED=1    repo-surgeon actually applies (else recorded only)
 *   JURY_DRAIN_POLL_SECONDS     loop interval (default 300)
 *   JURY_DRAIN_TENANT_ID        tenant for captured incidents (default 1)

// ── Replay-proof processed-entry ledger (HIGH-1 residual closure) ─────────────
// The DB (`jury_drain_ledger`) is the authoritative, out-of-tree store the
// app-writable queue.json cannot forge. `entry_key` is the secret-independent
// content fingerprint (jury-queue-integrity.entryFingerprint). The claim is
// intentionally GLOBAL (not tenant-scoped): replay protection is content-based —
// an entry processed under ANY tenant must never be replayable under another.
// `db` is passed in (lazy-imported in drainOnce) so importing this module for the
// pure-helper unit tests never opens a pg pool (node:test would hang otherwise).
//
// CLAIM-FIRST (MEDIUM closed 2026-06-10, Bob-approved): the old code did a
// check-then-act — read `ledgerHas`, then (much later, after a slow
// captureIncident) `ledgerRecord`. Two overlapping drainers could BOTH pass the
// existence check and BOTH route the same entry before either recorded it (a
// classic TOCTOU). `ledgerClaim` collapses check+record into ONE atomic write:
// `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id` — only one caller can win the
// unique-key insert; the loser gets no row back and is REPLAY BLOCKED. The row's
// mere existence IS the claim, so it must be inserted BEFORE the spend/route and
// RELEASED (deleted) if the route never completes, else a transient failure would
// be permanently mistaken for "already processed". A bounded STALE-CLAIM RECLAIM
// (see below) recovers the rare case where that release itself fails, WITHOUT
// reopening the replay window (completed rows are never reclaimable).

// STALE-CLAIM RECLAIM (MEDIUM closed 2026-06-10, architect follow-up): a pure
// "never reclaim" policy had an entry-LOSS hole — if `ledgerRelease` fails (a
// transient DELETE error, or a crash) on a route that did NOT complete, the
// orphaned `outcome='claimed'` row makes every later poll mistake the entry for a
// replay and stamp it `skipped:replay-ledger` FOREVER. We reclaim ONLY a STALE,
// still-`claimed` (never-completed) orphan. This does NOT reopen the replay window:
// a COMPLETED row has `outcome != 'claimed'` and is NEVER reclaimable, so a
// legitimately-processed fix can never be re-routed. CLAIM_STALE_SECONDS sits far
// above the worst-case per-entry route time so a live drainer is never stolen, and
// the conditional `UPDATE … RETURNING` is atomic so two racing reclaimers can't
// both win.
