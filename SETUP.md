# VisionClaw Agent Platform — Fork Setup Guide

Welcome! You've forked the **VisionClaw Agent Platform**, a multi-tenant agentic AI corporation platform built by [Your Company]. This guide will walk you through getting your own instance running.

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Database

Your Replit fork comes with a **PostgreSQL database** automatically provisioned. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set for you — no action needed.

On first run, the app will automatically:
- Create all 210 tables
- Build 616 production indexes
- Seed 41 governance rules
- Initialize 16 AI personas
- Set up 5 nightly autoresearch programs

> Authoritative counts: see [docs/CURRENT_PLATFORM_TOTALS.md](docs/CURRENT_PLATFORM_TOTALS.md).

### 2. Required Secrets

Open the **Secrets** tab (lock icon in the left sidebar) and add these:

| Secret | How to Get It | Why It's Needed |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Run `openssl rand -hex 32` in the Shell | Encrypts sessions and passwords |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) | Primary AI provider |
| `ADMIN_PIN` | Pick any 4+ digit number you'll remember | Gates `/admin/*` routes (admin operations, proposed-skills review, A/B run results) — without it, admin pages refuse to load |

That's it — with these three secrets, the platform boots, you can chat with all 16 AI personas, and you can reach the admin surfaces.

> **`ENABLE_SELF_PUSH`** (optional, advanced) — leave **unset** unless you want this fork to auto-push commits to your own GitHub remote. The two background workflows (`Auto Git Push`, `Public Mirror Push`) refuse to push without `ENABLE_SELF_PUSH=1`, so a fresh fork stays read-only by default.

### 3. Run

Click the **Run** button or use the Shell:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app starts on port 5000. You'll see a full startup log confirming all subsystems are online.

## Optional Secrets (Add as Needed)

These unlock additional capabilities. The platform works without them — features that need a missing key will gracefully degrade or show a clear message.

### AI Providers

| Secret | Service | What It Unlocks |

| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) | DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, MiniMax, 20+ models |

The platform has **cost-aware auto-routing** — it will always prefer free/cheap providers before paid ones. If you have Replit's AI integrations installed (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), those are used at $0 cost to you.

## Replit Integrations (Recommended)

Replit has built-in integrations that provide API access at no extra cost. Install these from the **Integrations** panel:

- **OpenAI** — Free GPT-4.1, GPT-5 Mini access
- **Anthropic** — Free Claude access
- **Gemini** — Free Gemini 3 Flash, 3.1 Pro access

## Customization

### Change the Company Branding
Update these locations:
- `client/src/pages/landing.tsx` — Landing page content, company name, stats
- `server/pdf-create.ts` — PDF cover page branding, logo, footer
- `data/visionclaw-logo.png` — Replace with your logo

### Add a New AI Persona
1. Insert a new row into the `personas` table via SQL
2. The persona automatically gets access to all tools
3. Customize tool access via the `persona_tool_access` table

### Add a New Tool
1. Add the tool definition to `server/tools.ts` in `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`
2. Add the execution handler in `server/tool-router.ts` in `executeTool()`
3. Run `sync_personas` to update all personas with the new tool

### Add a Governance Rule
```sql
INSERT INTO governance_rules (rule_name, category, description, enforcement_level, rule_config)
VALUES ('your_rule', 'operations', 'Description', 'strict', '{}');
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| App won't start | Check that `DATABASE_URL` and `SESSION_SECRET` are set |
| "No AI provider available" | Add at least one AI provider key (OpenAI recommended) |
| PDF generation fails | Add `BROWSERLESS_API_KEY` |
| Port 5000 in use | The app auto-retries 5 times with self-healing; restart if needed |
| Database migration error | The app auto-creates tables on startup — just restart |
| Empty AI responses | Check your API key is valid and has credits |

---

## Deployment

The app is configured for Replit Autoscale deployment:

```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
```

Click **Publish** in the Replit workspace to deploy. The platform handles TLS, health checks, and scaling automatically.
