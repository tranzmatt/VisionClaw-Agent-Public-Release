            {config.platformName} is a multi-tenant agentic AI platform that gives every business access to a full corporate AI team. Instead of hiring separate specialists, you get 16 AI personas — each with deep expertise — working together through 393 tools and 41 curated AI models in the registry plus 1000+ models discovered daily via OpenRouter, with a 4-model 1M+ token context fallback chain (Gemini 3.1 Pro → Claude Opus 4.7 → Nemotron 3 Super → Grok 4.1 Fast) so long-context conversations never die mid-thought. As of Round 74.13d (April 2026) the platform is genuinely proactive AND defensively hardened across three layers: foreground tool execution is tenant-isolated and admin-gated where appropriate, background services (heartbeat memory, knowledge writes, daily notes, task list, activity logs) are tenant-scoped at the storage layer, and the most sensitive secrets — Telegram bot tokens, WhatsApp/Baileys session credentials, password reset tokens, email verification codes — are encrypted or HMAC-hashed at rest. Low-risk insights auto-apply on every engine run, high-priority items draft a Minerva plan and land in Felix's approval queue, dead-lettered scheduled tasks self-remediate. We believe powerful AI shouldn't require a Fortune 500 budget or a team of engineers. Whether you want a full AI workforce on subscription, or a one-off productized deliverable from our Store, we meet you where you are.

R106 added 7 reflexive operating primitives (failure attribution L0–L5, parallel findings bus, near-miss grading, pinned hypotheses, plan-on-Graph DAG editing) wired across all 16 personas.</p>
